# odd_or_even
This is a simple odd or even game created using python
when the user runs it, a welcome message will be displayed and the user will be asked 
if they would like to play.
The user would be prompted to enter either y or yes. If the user does not enter y or yes the game is stopped and a goodbye message is printed to the user, if yes is answerd the rules will be displayed to the user and they will be prompted for their number. The system will make the choice on whether the user's number is even or odd and then display the result out to the user, after-which the user is prompted to play again.
